# Vagrant + Ansible + Docker Swarm + Traefik + NGINX template

Template repo that creates virtual machines with Docker, Docker Swarm, Traefik, NGINX. It shows how easy you can create "feature branch" deployment on your VPS

## Installation

Make sure that you have installed `vagrant` with `libvirt` plugin and `ansible`! Generate all env keys to access machine:

```bash
(cd keys/; ./generate-keys.sh)
```

Run vagrant and create vm (do not use `--create-vm` option if you want to only re-run ansible configure).

```bash
./start-dev.sh --create-vm
```

Edit you `/etc/hosts` on local machine and add these entries:

```bash
192.168.56.10 traefik.example.com
192.168.56.10 feature.example.com
```

And it works! You can enter these URLs:

```bash
Login: user
Password: 123456

http://traefik.example.com/dashboard/#/
http://feature.example.com/
```

## Add your public key

Add your public key to `keys/authorized/deploy/` folder and run `./start-dev.sh` to access server via `ssh deploy@192.168.56.10`.

## Deploy new env script

Just run on `deploy@192.168.56.10`:

```bash
/var/www/staging/script/setup.mjs --name="ladybug"
```

and after deployment visit (edit `/etc/hosts` before):

```bash
http://ladybug.example.com/
```

## Firewall

Project uses `iptables`. Find `rules.v4` file to customize firewall.

```bash
nmap -Pn 192.168.56.10
